In recent years declarative, constraint-based approaches have been proposed to model loosely-structured business processes, mediating between support and flexibility. A notable example is the Declare framework, equipped with a graphical declarative language whose semantics can be characterized with several logic-based formalisms. Up to now, the main problem hampering the use of Declare constraints in practice has been the difficulty with modeling constraints either with a formal notation, difficult to understand for users without a background in temporal logics, or with their graphical notation that has been proved to be unintuitive. In this work, we present and evaluate a tool that tries to bypass this issue by providing the user with the possibility of modeling Declare constraints using his/her own way of expressing them. The tool is a Declare modeler equipped with a vocal assistant that takes as input a vocal statement from the user and converts it into the closest (set of) Declare constraint(s). The inputs that can be provided to the tool cover the entire Multi-Perspective extension of Declare (MP-Declare) that can not only express control-flow properties, but also other perspectives like data and time. Even if we consider Declare as use case, the tool/evaluation presented in this paper can be considered, to the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to test the usability of speech recognition in business process modeling.
